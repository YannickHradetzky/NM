For a hermitian matrix $A$ the Rayleigh quotient of a vector $x$ is given by
$$
r(x):=\frac{x^{*}Ax}{x^{*}x}
$$
Where $x \in C^{n}$ and $x\neq 0$

For an eigenvalue-eigenvector pair $r(v)=\lambda$. 
And for each vector $x$ the Rayleigh quotient gives the value $\alpha:=r(x)$, which acts most like an eigenvalue.
